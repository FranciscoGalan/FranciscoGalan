### Hi! 

I'm a data analyst with an expertise in technical communication.  Currently, I teach at Mexico's most important Economics, Law, and  Political Science institution of higher learning. As the youngest  faculty member, I instruct over 70 students each semester on how to produce dashboards, reports, end-user  documentation, and presentations.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting the Tableau Desktop Specialist Certification.
